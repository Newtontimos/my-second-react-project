            Maintaining data availability contributes to your organizationâ€™s
            business continuity and disaster recovery plan, which is an
            important element of your data protection plan that relies on backup
            copies stored in a separate location. Having access to these copies
            minimizes downtime for your employees and keeps their work on track.
